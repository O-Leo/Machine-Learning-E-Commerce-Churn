By Fikri Bahiransyah JCDS 0308

### Context

This project is an implementation of Machine Learning for business, specifically for E-Commerce. This project using machine learning to indentify and to analyze the benefit on using machine learning for E-Commerce business.
The result of this project is to see if machine learning able to minimalize the loss from customer churn.

### Key Feature

• Data Exploratory from E-Commerce Dataset

•	Data Visualization

•	Classification Models

•	F2 Score

•	Tuning and Feature Engineering


### Objectives

•	To measure the impact of using Machine Learning for E-Commerce's customer churns

•	To identify variables that have significant impact towards customer churn


### Stakeholder

•	End Users : E-Commerce Business

•	Developers : Development team for developing and researching machine learning for e-commerce


### Limitations
This projects has several limitations to consider :

•	Dataset Limitation : Dataset have limited features and amount of data to have high accuracy with real problem

•	Model Limitation : Only few model tested for research purposes

This data will be used to help E-Commerce to identify customer that churn and making dicision to minimalize the loss of customer churn.
